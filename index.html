        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <h3>Why did I do Ironhack?</h3>

        <p>
          I choose Ironhack because after for years working at amazon.fr as a
          webmerchandiser & editorialist I wanted to improve my skills in UI
          and UX design. I wanted to learn more, about the design thinking and
          Agile methods, to developp my expertise in user research analysis
          and to enhance my skills in UI design.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you look for in a company culture ?</h3>

        <p>
          Most of all in company culture I'm looking for real partnership,
          team spirit and honnesty. I wan't the opportunity to grow with the
          company evolving with the project I lead and have the opportunity to
          developp new skills. I need to be aligned with the company project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
          ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
          and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
          only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
          with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
          and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
          PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
